  //i.e. it will beutify the output string by 2 spaces => now whole output will be printed as a string => preety print


// console.log(   JSON.stringify(body,undefined,2)); //what does response contains => response is parent of body. While body is main data/content, reposnse also contain other meta data along with body
//this includes status code: 404,200, etc
//body
//headers => these are set by API provider...we don't do/set them
//request => this is we can change/set according to our demands => tells what request we made and includes -
//uri - url, protocol, hash etc
//method - get, post, etc
//headers - that can be set by us For ex - we set json = true

//Now lets print the logitude and lang, adress of first result in body
//how to parse => go to jsonViewer and select line you want => you will get its value at bottom

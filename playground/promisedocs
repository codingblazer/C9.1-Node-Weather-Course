included in ES6 javascript
promise is used to do asynch task => DB/HTTP => when it has done the asych tasks, it has made a promise to do that for you without you knowing how i.e. abstraction
=> the promise then calls reject and resolve to tell whether promise is fulfilled or not
it's totally like function in geocde.js => it make asych request and returns eiether result or err message and is fully abstracted from app.js

=> Inside promise we can call resolved or rejected => then function is called with the results
=> promises remove all the if else statements and make code neat
then take 2 arguments which are both callbacks...first callback id called if resolved and 2nd callback is called if rejected.


if the promise is resolced or rejected once..it cant be resolved or rejected again => it ensures that we are calling callback just once i.e. sometimes callback gets called twice and creates problem

Now, let's see how to use promises full fledge i.e. with arguments and how it makes everything simple
